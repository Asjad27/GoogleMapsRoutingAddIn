# GoogleMapsRoutingAddIn
This is an AddIn for ArcGIS Pro, which utilizes Google Maps for obtaining routes between points selected on the map. 

For this AddIn, I have reused and modified the code for a ChromiumWebBrowser inside ArcGIS Pro in the SDK samples page (https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-pro-sdk-community-samples/tree/master/Framework/ChromiumWebBrowserSample)

A short demo of this AddIn is available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dSICx2NA6k)
